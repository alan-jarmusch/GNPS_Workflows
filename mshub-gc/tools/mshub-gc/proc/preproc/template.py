<Place the module description here>

<The following line should be present for the script to work properly as the 
description is split into header and tail according to it. Header is displayed 
at the start of the program and tail - when it finishes:>

run python.exe <template>.py --help to get info about parameters of the script

<replace "<template>" in the line above with your module name! Do not change
the rest!>

<Place here what you want to display at the end of you module running time,
e.g. references to the methods used, author info, acknowledgements etc. Please,
also keep in mind this section is used for module documentation automatic
generation>

#In your code if you use try: except: construct and possibly could encounter
#an error, but intend to continue executing code afterwards, then please make
#sure not to mask the exception with simple "pass" or print('Error!');
#Report full exception details and its trace to the log/screen in order to make
#it possible to track the exceptions and make sure that no hidden errors are
#lurking around making unexpectable mess in your results. Be transparent!
#Debugging hidden errors is tough, finding out your published results are rubbish
#because you did not even know there were errors is even worse. ;-)

#Please use the construct of the sort or better:
#
#try:
